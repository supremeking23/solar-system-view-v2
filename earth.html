                                <p>The realization that Earth is a planet, and a planet among many others was established
                                    “fairly” recently, in the 17th&nbsp;century – this realization came through by the
                                    combined forces of ancient philosophers, mathematicians,
                                    and astronomers.

                                    The name “Earth” – is at least 1.000&nbsp;years old, and it is a Germanic word which
                                    simply translates to “the ground.” It is not known who came up with it but it is the

                                <p>As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25
                                    days to
                                    complete one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge
                                    to our
                                    calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days.
                                    To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four
                                    years we add
                                    one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a leap
                                    year.<br>
                                </p>
                                <p>Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's
                                    orbit around
                                    the Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the
                                    northern
                                    hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun and
                                    the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar
                                    heating is greater
                                    in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating produces winter in
                                    the south. Six
                                    months later, the situation is reversed.
                                    When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of heat
                                    from the
                                    Sun.<br></p>

                            <p>The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals about 759 miles
                                (1,221
                                kilometers) in radius. There the temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit
                                (5,400
                                degrees Celsius). Surrounding the inner core is the outer
                                core. This layer is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and

                            <p>In between the outer core and crust is the mantle, the thickest layer. This hot,
                                viscous mixture
                                of molten rock is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency
                                of caramel.
                                The outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes
                                about 19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean,
                                the crust is
                                thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the sea floor to the top of

                            surface with
                            mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is
                            an ocean
                            planet. Water covers 70 percent of Earth's surface.<br></p>
                        <p>Earth's atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to
                            breathe. The
                            atmosphere also protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up before
                            they can hit
                            the surface.<br>

                            <p>Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains and valleys. Earth's lithosphere,
                                which
                                includes the crust (both continental and oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided
                                into huge
                                plates that are constantly moving. For example,
                                the North American plate moves west over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at a rate
                                equal to the
                                growth of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another,
                                ride up over
                                one another, collide to make mountains,
                                or split and separate.<br></p>
                            <p>Earth's global ocean, which covers nearly 70 percent of the planet's surface, has an
                                average
                                depth of about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) and contains 97 percent of Earth's water.
                                Almost all of
                                Earth's volcanoes are hidden under these oceans.
                                Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base to summit than Mount Everest, but
                                most of it is
                                underwater. Earth's longest mountain range is also underwater, at the bottom of the
                                Arctic and
                                Atlantic oceans. It is four times longer
                                than the Andes, Rockies and Himalayas combined.<br>

                        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
                    
                        <p>Near the surface, Earth has an atmosphere that consists of 78 percent nitrogen, 21
                            percent
                            oxygen, and 1 percent other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide and neon. The
                            atmosphere affects
                            Earth's long-term climate and short-term local
                            weather and shields us from much of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun. It
                            also protects
                            us from meteoroids, most of which burn up in the atmosphere, seen as meteors in the
                            night sky,
                            before they can strike the surface as
                            meteorites.<br></p>

                            <p>Our planet's rapid rotation and molten nickel-iron core give rise to a magnetic
                                field, which the
                                solar wind distorts into a teardrop shape in space. (The solar wind is a stream of
                                charged
                                particles continuously ejected from the Sun.)
                                When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic field,
                                they
                                collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles. These air molecules
                                then begin to
                                glow and cause aurorae, or the northern and
                                southern lights.<br></p>
                            <p>The magnetic field is what causes compass needles to point to the North Pole
                                regardless of which
                                way you turn. But the magnetic polarity of Earth can change, flipping the direction
                                of the
                                magnetic field. The geologic record tells scientists
                                that a magnetic reversal takes place about every 400,000 years on average, but the
                                timing is
                                very irregular. As far as we know, such a magnetic reversal doesn't cause any harm
                                to life on
                                Earth, and a reversal is very unlikely to
                                happen for at least another thousand years. But when it does happen, compass needles
                                are likely
                                to point in many different directions for a few centuries while the switch is being
                                made. And
                                after the switch is completed, they will
                                all point south instead of north.​<br></p>

                            <p>Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most
                                familiar
                                object in the night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such
                                a great
                                home. It stabilizes our planet's wobble, which
                                has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.<br></p>
                            <p>Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks. They are
                                typically trapped
                                by Earth's gravity for a a few months or years before returning to an orbit around
                                the Sun. Some
                                asteroids will be in a long “dance” with
                                Earth as both orbit the Sun.<br></p>
                            <p>Some moons are bits of rock that were captured by a planet's gravity, but our Moon is
                                likely the
                                result of a collision billions of years ago. When Earth was a young planet, a large
                                chunk of
                                rock smashed into it, displacing a portion
                                of Earth's interior. The resulting chunks clumped together and formed our Moon. With
                                a radius of
                                1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers), the Moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar
                                system (after
                                Ganymede, Titan, Callisto and Io).<br></p>
                            <p>The Moon is farther away from Earth than most people realize. The Moon is an average
                                of 238,855
                                miles (384,400 kilometers) away. That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in
                                between Earth
                                and the Moon.<br>

                            <p>Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life
                                possible here.
                                Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in water, since
                                the
                                temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended
                                periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin
                                about 3.8
                                billion years ago.<br></p>
                            <p>Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are
                                changing due to the
