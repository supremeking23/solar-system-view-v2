                                landscapes in our solar system. From the jets of water that spray from Enceladus to the
                                methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific
                                discovery and still holds many mysteries.</p>
                            <p>The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known
                                since ancient times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth,
                                who was also the father of Jupiter.

                        <p>With an average temperature of minus 288 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 178 degrees Celsius),
                            Saturn is a pretty cool planet. Although there are some small differences as one travels
                            from the equator to the poles, much of Saturn's temperature variation is horizontal.
                            This is because most of the planet's heat comes from its interior, rather than from the
                            sun.

                             <p>Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system. One day on Saturn takes only
                                10.7 hours (the time it takes for Saturn to rotate or spin around once), and Saturn
                                makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Saturnian time) in about 29.4 Earth
                                years (10,756 Earth days).

                            <p>Its axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees with respect to its orbit around the Sun, which
                                is similar to Earth's 23.5-degree tilt. This means that, like Earth, Saturn
                                experiences seasons.</p>

                            <p>Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. At Saturn's center is a
                                dense core of metals like iron and nickel surrounded by rocky material and other
                                compounds solidified by the intense pressure and heat. It is enveloped by liquid
                                metallic hydrogen inside a layer of liquid hydrogen—similar to Jupiter's core but
                                considerably smaller.</p>
                            <p>It's hard to imagine, but Saturn is the only planet in our solar system whose average
                                density is less than water. The giant gas planet could float in a bathtub if such a
                                colossal thing existed.</p>

                                ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this gas giant. About 4
                                billion years ago, Saturn settled into its current position in the outer solar
                                system, where it is the sixth planet from the Sun. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly
                                made of hydrogen and helium, the same two main components that make up the Sun.</p>

                            gases and liquids deeper down. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on

                    <p>Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes, jet streams and storms.
                        The planet is many different shades of yellow, brown and grey.

                    </p>
                    <p>Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 1,600 feet per second (500 meters per second) in
                        the equatorial region. In contrast, the strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top
                        out at about 360 feet per second (110 meters per second). And the pressure—the same
                        kind you feel when you dive deep underwater—is so powerful it squeezes gas into
                        liquid.</p>

                    <p>Saturn's north pole has an interesting atmospheric feature—a six-sided jet stream.
                        This hexagon-shaped pattern was first noticed in images from the Voyager I
                        spacecraft and has been more closely observed by the Cassini spacecraft since.
                        Spanning about 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across, the hexagon is a wavy jet
                        stream of 200-mile-per-hour winds (about 322 kilometers per hour) with a massive,
                        rotating storm at the center. There is no weather feature like it anywhere else in
                        the solar system.

                <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            
                <p>Saturn's magnetic field is smaller than Jupiter's but still 578 times as powerful as
                    Earth's. Saturn, the rings, and many of the satellites lie totally within Saturn's
                    enormous magnetosphere, the region of space in which the behavior of electrically
                    charged particles is influenced more by Saturn's magnetic field than by the solar
                    wind.</p>

                <p>Aurorae occur when charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic
                    field lines. On Earth, these charged particles come from the solar wind. Cassini
                    showed that at least some of Saturn's aurorae are like Jupiter's and are largely
                    unaffected by the solar wind. Instead, these aurorae are caused by a combination of
                    particles ejected from Saturn's moons and Saturn's magnetic field's rapid rotation
                    rate. But these "non-solar-originating" aurorae are not completely understood yet.

                <h2>Rings</h2>

                <p>Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids or shattered moons that
                    broke up before they reached the planet, torn apart by Saturn's powerful gravity.
                    They are made of billions of small chunks of ice and rock coated with another
                    material such as dust. The ring particles mostly range from tiny, dust-sized icy
                    grains to chunks as big as a house. A few particles are as large as mountains. The
                    rings would look mostly white if you looked at them from the cloud tops of Saturn,
                    and interestingly, each ring orbits at a different speed around the planet.</p>


                <p>
                    Saturn's ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the
                    planet, yet the vertical height is typically about 30 feet (10 meters) in the main
                    rings. Named alphabetically in the order they were discovered, the rings are
                    relatively close to each other, with the exception of a gap measuring 2,920 miles
                    (4,700 kilometers) wide called the Cassini Division that separates Rings A and B.
                    The main rings are A, B and C. Rings D, E, F and G are fainter and more recently
                    discovered.
                </p>
                <p>Starting at Saturn and moving outward, there is the D ring, C ring, B ring, Cassini
                    Division, A ring, F ring, G ring, and finally, the E ring. Much farther out, there
                    is the very faint Phoebe ring in the orbit of Saturn's moon Phoebe.</p>

                <h2>Moon</h2>
                <p>Saturn is home to a vast array of intriguing and unique worlds. From the
                    haze-shrouded surface of Titan to crater-riddled Phoebe, each of Saturn's moons
                    tells another piece of the story surrounding the Saturn system. Currently Saturn has
                    53 confirmed moons with 29 additional provisional moons awaiting confirmation. </p>

                <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            
                <p>Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures,
                    pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme
                    and volatile for organisms to adapt to.</p>
                <p>While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is
                    not true of some of its many moons. Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to
                    internal oceans, could possibly support life.</p>
